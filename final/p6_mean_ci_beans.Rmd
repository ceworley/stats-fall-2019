Question
========

Brahim wants to estimate the average mass of the beans in a large bag. Somehow, Brahim is certain that the standard deviation of the beans in the bag is `r sig` milligrams. He takes a sample of size `r n` and finds the sample mean to be `r xbar` milligrams. What would be the `r cl*100`% confidence interval?

Solution
========

We are given the sample size, sample mean, population standard deviation, and confidence level.
$$
\begin{aligned}
n &= `r n` \\
\bar{x} &= `r xbar` \\
\sigma &= `r sig`\\
\gamma &= `r cl`
\end{aligned}
$$

Determine the critical $z$ value, $z^\star$, such that $P(|Z|<z^\star) = `r cl`$. Remember, $\ell = \frac{\gamma+1}{2} = \frac{`r cl`+1}{2} = `r (cl+1)/2`$
$$z^\star = `r zstar` $$
Use the formula for bounds (mean, $\sigma$ known).
$$
\begin{aligned}
LB &= \bar{x} - z^\star \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} &&&&& UB &= \bar{x} + z^\star \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \\
   &= `r xbar` - `r zstar`\times \frac{`r sig`}{\sqrt{`r n`}} &&&&&& =`r xbar` + `r zstar`\times \frac{`r sig`}{\sqrt{`r n`}} \\
   &= `r lb` &&&&&& =`r ub` 
\end{aligned}
$$
We are `r cl*100`% confident that the population mean is between `r lb` and `r ub` milligrams.
$$CI = (`r lb`, \, `r ub`)$$
