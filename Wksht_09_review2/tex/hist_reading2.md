Answerlist
--------
* Describe the overall shape of the distribution. (symmetric mound, skew left, skew right, uniform, or bimodal)
* Estimate the range of the distribution (range = max-min).
* What percent of the measurements are less than 27.5?
* What percent of the measurements are less than 26.5?
* What percent of the measurements are between 26.5 and 27.5?
* What percent of the measurements are within 0.25 from 27.25? In other words, what percent of measurements satisfy $|x-27.25| \le 0.25$?
* Of the measurements less than 27.5, what percent are less than 26.5?
* Estimate the value of the 7th percentile. In other words, determine a value such that 7% of the measurements are less than or equal to it.
