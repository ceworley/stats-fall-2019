Question
========

A continuous random variable was measured 100 times. The resulting frequency distribution is shown below.

| class | frequency |
|:-----:|:---------:|
|50--60|3|
|60--70|3|
|70--80|4|
|80--90|8|
|90--100|11|
|100--110|16|
|110--120|16|
|120--130|22|
|130--140|17|





Answerlist
--------
* Describe the overall shape of the distribution. (symmetric mound, skew left, skew right, uniform, or bimodal)
* Estimate the range of the distribution (range = max-min).
* What percent of the measurements are less than 80?
* What percent of the measurements are less than 60?
* What percent of the measurements are between 60 and 80?
* What percent of the measurements are within 10 of 80? In other words, what percent of measurements satisfy $|x-80| \le 10$?
* Of the measurements less than 80, what percent are less than 60?
* Estimate the value of the 45th percentile. In other words, determine a value such that 45% of the measurements are less than or equal to it.
