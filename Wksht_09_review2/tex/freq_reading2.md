Question
========

A continuous random variable was measured 300 times. The resulting frequency distribution is shown below.

| class | frequency |
|:-----:|:---------:|
|10--11|10|
|11--12|39|
|12--13|28|
|13--14|26|
|14--15|28|
|15--16|29|
|16--17|32|
|17--18|31|
|18--19|29|
|19--20|34|
|20--21|14|





Answerlist
--------
* Describe the overall shape of the distribution. (symmetric mound, skew left, skew right, uniform, or bimodal)
* Estimate the range of the distribution (range = max-min).
* What percent of the measurements are less than 12?
* What percent of the measurements are greater than 11?
* What percent of the measurements are between 11 and 12?
* What percent of the measurements are within 1.5 of 13.5? In other words, what percent of measurements satisfy $|x-13.5| \le 1.5$?
* Of the measurements less than 12, what percent are greater than 11?
* Estimate the value of the 25.67th percentile. In other words, determine a value such that 25.67% of the measurements are less than or equal to it.
