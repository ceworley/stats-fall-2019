# stats-fall-2019

This repository is for teaching materials for introductory statistics. I hope to develop all the materials in R, Rmarkdown, and Rexams. I might still need to some LaTeX documents, but I worry that LaTeX is less accessible.

Last semester I used OpenIntro Statistics. It is a beautifully constructed text with excellent problems. However, I feel that my students might prefer a different approach.

I hope to have procedural skills (not definitions) learned in every class. And for each of these procedural skills, an Rexams script should be able to generate problems. Many of my students have trouble parsing the word problems, so I hope that the exams can use very similar language to the language in the practice problems.

I feel this will require less time connecting the ideas to real life and more time discussing simple, ideal scenarios. In particular, an idealized spinner (random number generator) can stand in for the ideal population. 

Anyway, we will see how this goes...
