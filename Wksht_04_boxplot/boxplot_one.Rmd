## DATA GENERATION

types = c("bimodal","symmetric mound","skew left","skew right","uniform")
shapes1 = c(0.5, 20,   3,   1, 1)
shapes2 = c(0.5, 20,   1,   3, 1)

type = types[rrr]
shape1 = shapes1[rrr]
shape2 = shapes2[rrr]

Question
========

A continuous random variable $X$ was measured `r n` times. The sorted measurements are shown below.

`r knitr::kable(t(matrix(x,ncol=ncol)))`

Create a boxplot representing these measurements.


Solution
========

`r 0.25*n`
`r q1`

`r q2`

`r q3`
