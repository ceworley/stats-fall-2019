Question
========

A continuous random variable $X$ was measured `r n` times. The sorted data are shown below.

`r knitr::kable(t(matrix(x,ncol=ncol)))`

The sum of the measurements is `r sum(x)`.


Answerlist
--------
* What is the median of the measurements?
* What is the mean of the measurements?

Solution
========


Answerlist
--------
* The mean is $\frac{`r sum(x)`}{`r n`} = `r signif(mean(x),5)`$
* If $n$ is odd, then median is $x_{\frac{n+1}{2}}$, the value of $x$ when $i=\frac{n+1}{2}$. Otherwise median is mean of $x_{\lfloor \frac{n+1}{2} \rfloor}$ and $x_{\lceil \frac{n+1}{2} \rceil}$. So, median = $`r signif(median(x),5)`$.
