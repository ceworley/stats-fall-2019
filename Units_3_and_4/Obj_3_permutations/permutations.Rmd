```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
names = read.csv("names2.txt", header = FALSE, sep = ",")

na = sample(names,1)
nu = sample(7:25,1)
n = sample(3:8,1)

s1 = ''
s1 = paste(s1, nu, sep="")
for(i in 1:(n-1)){
  s1 = paste(s1,'\\cdot',nu-i)
}

```

Question
========

`r na` is generating a random sequence of numbers by grabbing numbered marbles from a jar. Each marble has a different number, and every natural number from 1 to `r nu` is represented.

`r na` will generate a sequence of length `r n` by grabbing 1 marble at a time and not replacing the marble before grabbing another. How many possibilites exist?


Solution
========

`r na` is generating permutations, because sequences have a specified order. The population size is $\nu = `r nu`$. The sample size is $n = `r n`$. 

$$\begin{aligned}
_{\nu} P _n &= \frac{\nu !}{(\nu-n)!} \\ \\
{_{`r nu`} P_{`r n`}} & = \frac{`r nu`!}{(`r nu`-`r n`)!} \\ \\
&= \frac{`r nu`!}{`r nu-n`!} \\ \\
&= `r s1` \\  \\
&= `r format(factorial(nu)/factorial(nu-n),scientific=F)`
\end{aligned}
$$
