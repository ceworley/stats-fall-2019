Question
========

`r q`

Solution
========

This scenario describes a combinations problem (order does not matter). We are considering the subsets of size `r x` from a set of size `r n`.

$$\begin{aligned}
{_nC_r} &= \frac{n!}{(n-r)! \cdot r!} \\ \\
n &= `r n` \\\\
r &= `r x` \\\\
{_{`r n`}C_{`r x`}} &= \frac{`r n`!}{(`r n`-`r x`)!\cdot `r x`! } \\ \\
&= \frac{`r n`!}{`r n-x`! \cdot `r x`!} \\ \\
&= \frac{`r sss`}{`r ss2`} \\ \\
&= \fbox{`r format(ans,scientific=F)`} 
\end{aligned}$$
