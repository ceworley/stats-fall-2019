```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
names = read.csv("names2.txt", header = FALSE, sep = ",")

item = c("hat","coat","shirt","pair of pants","scarf","pair of shoes","necklace","bracelet")
items = c("hats","coats","shirts","pairs of pants","scarves","pairs of shoes","necklaces","bracelets")


while(T){
  ns = sample(2:6,2,replace=T)
  if(prod(ns) < 21){
    break
  }
}

na = sample(names,1)
i = sample(1:length(item),2)
it = item[i]
its = items[i]
```

Question
========

`r na` is getting dressed, and still needs to pick a `r it[1]` and a `r it[2]`. `r na` has `r ns[1]` `r its[1]` and `r ns[2]` `r its[2]`. How many different outfit combinations are possible?



Solution
========

Multiply `r ns[1]` and `r ns[2]`.

$$\fbox{There are `r prod(ns)` combinations possible.} $$
