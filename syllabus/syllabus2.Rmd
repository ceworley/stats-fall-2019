## Teaching procedures

* We will have lectures, worksheets, homeworks and exams.
* You	will	engage	in	a	variety	of	learning	methodologies	in	working	toward	these	objectives.		You	will	be	engaged	 in	 problem	 solving,	 collaborative	 learning,	 writing	 reflections,	 working	 individually	 and	 in	groups	 during	 classroom	 meetings	 and	 outside	 of	 class.


## Course Description
* Mat-098 is designed as a substitute for Foundations of Algebra (MAT097) for non-STEM students who will be taking Statistics I (MAT181) for their program requirements. Topics include being able to summarize and analyze data distributions both numerically and graphically. Evaluating linear equations while understanding the concepts of slope, intercepts, inequalities, correlation and regression will be discussed. The concept of probability and probability distributions will be introduced for both discrete and continuous variables. This course does not satisfy degree requirements. Prerequisite: Grade of C or better in Foundations of Mathematics (MAT093) or placement. 
* Mat-181 covers statistical concepts and methods. Topics include data organization, averages and variation; elementary probability; binomial, normal, and t-distributions; estimation and hypothesis testing; and linear correlation and regression. The course meets the General Education requirement for Quantitative Problem Solving. Prerequisite: Grade of C or better in Foundations of Algebra (MAT097) or Pre-Statistics (MAT098) or placement.

## Attendance
Students	are	expected	to	attend	ALL	scheduled	classes	and	to	arrive	ON	TIME.		Statistics	have	shown	that	grades	improve	with	better	attendance.		The	College’s	policy	is	that	a	student	is	expected	to	come	to	all	class	sessions	prepared	to	participate	in	an	appropriate	manner.		Absence	from	class	is considered	a	serious	matter	and	never	excuses	a	student	from	class	work.		A	student	must	complete	all	assignments,	exams,	and	other	requirements	to	receive	credit.	It	is	the	student’s	responsibility	to	notify	the	instructor	on	or	before	the	date	of	the	absence.		


## Assistance	and Time on Task
Students	will	have	the	assistance	of	the	instructor	during	class,	during	office	hours,	or	by	appointment. Students	are	encouraged	to	use	the	Math	Space	(E234-D	or	E)	outside	of	class	to	receive	help. Your classmates	are	also	valuable	resources.		You	should	spend	a	minimum	of	10-12	hours	per	week	(an	
average	 of	 1+	 hours	 per	 weekday)	 on	 course	 assignments	 in	 order	 to	 be	 successful. Your	instructor	will	closely	monitor	your	progress	and	will	speak	with	you	if	you	fall	behind	schedule.

## Code of conduct
All	students	are	expected	to	adhere	to	the	honor	code	regarding	course	assignments	and	exams.		This	includes	completing	assignments	without	unauthorized	aid	when	instructed.		Any	student	suspected	of	cheating	on	an	assignment	or	an	exam	will	not	pass	that	assignment	or	exam.

**Student Responsibilities**

* To	be	knowledgeable	of	and	to	comply	with	laws,	all	civic	and	College	regulations	and	the	directives,	policies	and	procedures	of	the	federal	government,	Commonwealth,	the	Massachusetts	Board	of	Higher	Education,	Bunker	Hill	Community	College	and	the	Student	Government	Association.	
* To	behave	in	a	manner	that	is	respectful	of	all	individuals	including	faculty	members,	College	staff,	administrators	and	students.	
* To	behave	in	a	manner	that	is	respectful	of	the	property	of	individuals,	groups	and	the	College.	
* To	maintain	a	high	standard	of	honesty.

* To	 behave	 in	 a	 manner	 that	 does	 not	 disrupt	 or	 interfere	 with	 the	 learning	 environment	 of	 others	 inside	 and	 outside	 of	 the	classroom	including	at	College	events.	

## IN	PROGRESS	(IP)	GRADE
If	 a	 student	 does	 not	 finish	 all	 coursework	 within	 the	 15-week	 semester,	 he/she	 may	 receive	 an	 “In	Progress”	grade	only	if	the	following	conditions	are	met:

1. The	student	has	no	more	than	two	(2)	unexcused	absences.
2. The	student	is	making	steady	progress	with	the	course	material	AND	has	passed	three	exams
3. During	the	last	week	of	class,	you	must	sign	an	IP	contract	form	stating	the	conditions	for	completion	of	the	remaining	course	requirements.


## INDIVIDUALS	WITH	A	DISABILITY
Bunker	Hill	Community	College	is	committed	to	providing	equal	access	to	the	educational	experience	for	all	students	in	compliance	with	Section	504	of	the	Rehabilitation	Act	of	1973	and	the	Americans	with	Disabilities	Act	of	1990.
