Answer key to review homework...


Is mean higher, lower, or about equal to median?
Is median higher, lower, or about equal to mean?
skew right, skew left, symmetric (bell,uniform,bimodal)
"Should" you caution someone against using mean?

boxplots compare - which has median equal to X?
				 - which ones have medians higher than X?
				 - which has largest percentage over X?

Intervals (2) of typical measurements (easy)

Make histogram - format similar to test... (relative freq and give table and graph paper)

AAD special cases (2 nums repeated, uniform)

Dots on line -> hist
Dots on line -> boxplot
