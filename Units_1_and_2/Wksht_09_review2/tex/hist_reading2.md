* Describe the overall shape of the distribution. (symmetric mound, skew left, skew right, uniform, or bimodal)
* Estimate the range of the distribution (range = max-min).
* What percent of the measurements are less than 13?
* What percent of the measurements are less than 12?
* What percent of the measurements are between 12 and 13?
* What percent of the measurements are within 0.25 from 13.25? In other words, what percent of measurements satisfy $|x-13.25| \le 0.25$?
* Of the measurements less than 13, what percent are less than 12?
* Estimate the value of the 61th percentile. In other words, determine a value such that 61% of the measurements are less than or equal to it.
