Question
========

A continuous random variable $X$ was measured `r n` times. The sorted measurements are shown below.

`r knitr::kable(t(matrix(x,ncol=ncol)))`

Create a boxplot representing these measurements.


Solution
========

We first determine the median of all measurements. We note that $n = `r n`$, so $n$ is `r word`. We use the appropriate method.
`r eq1`
