## DATA GENERATION
b1 = 10**runif(6,-0.5,0.75)
b2 = 10**runif(6,-0.5,0.75)
scale = 10**(sample(-1:3,1))
bottom = runif(6)*scale

x = numeric()

  x = c(x, sort(rbeta(23,b1[i],b2[i])*scale+bottom[i]))
}

ms = c("weight","length","time","speed")
us = c("kg","m","s","m/s")

rvs = c("P","Q","R","S","T","U")

```

Question
========
Six random variables were each measured 23 times. The resulting boxplots are shown.

```{r boxies, echo=F}
grps = c(rep("P",23),rep("Q",23),rep("R",23),rep("S",23),rep("T",23),rep("U",23))
boxplot(x~grps, horizontal=T)
```
