Question
========

Marcel has discovered a new species of fish. He hopes to characterize the average length of this new species, so he obtains a sample of `r n` specimens, which have a sample mean of `r xbar` centimeters and a sample standard deviation of `r s` centimeters. Determine the `r cl*100`% confidence interval of the new species' average length.

Solution
========

We are given the sample size, sample mean, sample standard deviation, and confidence level.
$$
\begin{aligned}
n &= `r n` \\
\bar{x} &= `r xbar` \\
s &= `r s`\\
\gamma &= `r cl`
\end{aligned}
$$
Find the degrees of freedom.
$$\begin{aligned}
df &= n-1 \\
&= `r n`-1 \\
&= `r df`
\end{aligned}$$
Determine the critical $t$ value, $t^\star$, such that $P(|T|<t^\star) = `r cl`$ and $df=`r df`$. 
$$t^\star = `r tstar` $$
Use the formula for bounds (mean, $\sigma$ unknown).
$$
\begin{aligned}
LB &= \bar{x} - t^\star \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} &&&&& UB &= \bar{x} + t^\star \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \\
   &= `r xbar` - `r tstar`\times \frac{`r s`}{\sqrt{`r n`}} &&&&&& =`r xbar` + `r tstar`\times \frac{`r s`}{\sqrt{`r n`}} \\
   &= `r lb` &&&&&&= `r ub` 
\end{aligned}
$$
We are `r cl*100`% confident that the population mean is between `r lb` and `r ub` centimeters.
$$CI = (`r lb`, \, `r ub`)$$
