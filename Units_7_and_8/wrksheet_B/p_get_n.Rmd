Question
========

If you suspect that $\hat{p}$ will be near `r p`, how large of a sample is needed to guarantee a margin of error less than `r ME` when building a `r CL*100`% confidence interval?


Solution
========

Determine $z^\star$ such that $P(|Z|<z^\star) = `r CL`$.
$$z^\star = `r zstar`$$
Determine the maximal standard error.
$$ME = z^\star \sigma_{\hat{p}} $$

$$\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \frac{ME}{z^\star} = \frac{`r ME`}{`r zstar`} = `r SE` $$
Calculate $n$.
$$\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$$

$$n = \frac{p(1-p)}{\sigma_{\hat{p}}^2} = \frac{(`r p`)(`r 1-p`)}{(`r SE`)^2} = `r p*(1-p)/SE^2`$$

When determining a necessary sample size, always round up (ceiling).
$$n = `r n` $$
Also, for simplicity, you should probably only use about 2 significant digits, while still rounding up.
$$n = `r n2` $$
