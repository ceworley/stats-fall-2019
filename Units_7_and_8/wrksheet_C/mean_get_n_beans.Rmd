Question
========

Brahim wants to estimate the average mass of the beans in a large bag. Somehow, Brahim is certain that the standard deviation of the beans in the bag is `r sig` milligrams. He knows he wants the margin of error to be `r ME` when determining a `r gam*100`% confidence interval. How large of a sample does Brahim need?


Solution
========

We are given the population standard deviation, confidence level, and margin of error.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma &= `r sig`\\
\gamma &= `r gam`\\
ME &= `r ME`
\end{aligned}
$$

Determine the critical $z$ value, $z^\star$, such that $P(|Z|<z^\star) = `r gam`$. Remember, $\ell = \frac{\gamma+1}{2} = \frac{`r gam`+1}{2} = `r (gam+1)/2`$
$$z^\star = `r z` $$
Use the formula for sample size.
$$\begin{aligned}
n &= \left(\frac{z^\star \sigma}{ME} \right)^2 \\\\
&= \left(\frac{(`r z`)(`r sig`)}{`r ME`}\right)^2 \\\\
&= `r n`
\end{aligned}$$
Round up.
$$n = `r n2` $$
