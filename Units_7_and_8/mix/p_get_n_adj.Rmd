Question
========

Your boss wants to know what proportion of a very large population is `r adj`. You already know the proportion approximately $`r p`$. But, your boss wants to guarantee that the margin of error of a `r CL*100`% confidence interval will be less than `r ME` (which is `r 100*ME` percentage points). How large of a sample is needed?

Solution
========

We are given the confidence level and the margin of error.
$$\begin{aligned} 
\gamma &= `r CL` \\
ME &= `r ME`
\end{aligned}$$

Determine $z^\star$ such that $P(|Z|<z^\star) = `r CL`$. It is helpful to get the percentile of $z^\star$ by using $\ell = \frac{1+\gamma}{2} = \frac{1+`r CL`}{2} = `r (1+CL)/2`$. This lets you find $z^\star$ such that $P(Z<z^\star) = `r (1+CL)/2`$.
$$z^\star = `r zstar`$$
Use the appropriate formula. 
$$\begin{aligned}
n &= \hat{p}(1-\hat{p})\left(\frac{z^\star}{ME} \right)^2 \\ \\
&= (`r p`)(`r 1-p`)\left(\frac{`r zstar`}{`r ME`} \right)^2 \\ \\
&= `r p*(1-p)*zstar^2/ME^2`
\end{aligned}$$

When determining a necessary sample size, always round up (ceiling).
$$n = `r ceiling(p*(1-p)*zstar^2/ME^2)` $$
