Question
========

A random sample of size `r n` was found to have a sample proportion of `r phat*100`% (because there were `r sucs` successes). Determine a `r CL*100`% confidence interval of the population proportion.


Answerlist
----------
* Find the lower bound of the confidence interval.
* Find the upper bound of the condifence interval.



Solution
========

Identify the givens.
$$\begin{aligned}
n &= `r n` \\
\hat{p} &= `r phat` \\
\gamma &= `r CL`
\end{aligned}$$

Determine $z^\star$ such that $P(|Z|<z^\star) = `r CL`$. It is helpful to know that $\ell=\frac{\gamma+1}{2} = \frac{`r CL`+1}{2} = `r perc`$. (Use the $z$-table to find $z^{\star}$.)
$$z^\star = `r zstar` $$
Use the formula (proportion) for the bounds.
$$\begin{aligned}
LB &= \hat{p}-z^\star\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} &&&&&
UB &= \hat{p}+z^\star\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} \\ \\
&= `r phat`-`r zstar`\sqrt{\frac{(`r phat`)(`r 1-phat`)}{`r n`}} &&&&&
&= `r phat`+`r zstar`\sqrt{\frac{(`r phat`)(`r 1-phat`)}{`r n`}} \\ \\
&= `r plo` &&&&& &= `r pup`
\end{aligned}$$

Determine the interval.
$$CI ~=~ (`r plo`\,,~ `r pup`) $$
We are `r CL*100`% confident that the true population proportion is between `r plo*100`% and `r pup*100`%.


Answerlist
----------
* The lower bound = `r plo`, which can also be expressed as `r plo*100`%.
* The upper bound = `r pup`, which can also be expressed as `r pup*100`%.
