Question
========

A random sample of size `r n` was found to have a sample proportion of `r phat*100`%. Determine a `r CL*100`% confidence interval of the population proportion.


Answerlist
----------
* Find the lower bound of the confidence interval.
* Find the upper bound of the condifence interval.



Solution
========

Determine $z^\star$ such that $P(|Z|<z^\star) = `r CL`$.
$$z^\star = `r zstar` $$
Calculate the standard error.
$$SE = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{(`r phat`)(1-`r phat`)}{`r n`}} = `r se` $$
Calculate the margin of error.
$$ME = z^\star SE = (`r zstar`)(`r se`) = `r signif(zstar*se,3)` $$
To find the confidence interval's bounds, find the sample proportion plus or minus the margin of error.
$$p ~\approx~ \hat{p} \pm ME $$
Determine the interval.
$$(`r plo`\,,~ `r pup`) $$
We are `r CL*100`% confident that the true population proportion is between `r plo*100`% and `r pup*100`%.


Answerlist
----------
* The lower bound = `r plo`, which can also be expressed as `r plo*100`%.
* The upper bound = `r pup`, which can also be expressed as `r pup*100`%.
