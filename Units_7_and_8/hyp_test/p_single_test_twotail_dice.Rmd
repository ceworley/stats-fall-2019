Question
========

A fair `r sides`-sided die should have a `r p*100`% chance of landing on any specific side. Someone is mildly suspicious that a `r sides`-sided die is weighted to alter the probability of rolling a 1.

You are asked to judge the fairness of the `r sides`-sided die by rolling it `r n` times and counting how many 1s are rolled. You are told to use a significance level of `r alpha`.

Then, you actually roll the die `r n` times and get `r ns` rolls of 1. Should we conclude this die is weighted?


Answerlist
--------
* What kind of hypothesis test is appropriate?
* State the hypotheses
* Determine the $p$-value.
* Decide whether we reject or retain the null hypothesis.
* Do you think the die is weighted?


Solution
========

We should use a two-tail proportion test.

State the hypotheses.
$$H_0 ~~\text{ claims } ~~ p = `r p` $$
$$H_\text{A} ~~\text{ claims } ~~ p \ne `r p`$$
Determine the standard error.
$$\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{`r p`(1-`r p`)}{`r n`}} = `r se` $$
Determine the sample proportion.
$$\hat{p} = `r phat` $$
Determine a $z$ score. For simplicity, we ignore the continuity correction.
$$z = \frac{\hat{p}-p_0}{\sigma_{\hat{p}}} = \frac{`r phat`-`r p`}{`r se`} = `r z` $$
Make a sketch of the null's sampling distribution. The $p$-value is a two-tail area.

```{r p_single_test_twotail, echo = FALSE, results = "hide", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, fig.path = "", fig.cap = ""}
par(mar=c(5,3,1,1))
zs = seq(-3,3,length=1000)
ys = dnorm(zs)
plot(zs, ys, 'l',xlim = c(-3,3), ylim = c(0,0.4),
     ann=FALSE,xaxt="n",yaxt="n",
     lwd=1,bty='n')
axis(side=1, line=0, at=-3:3, labels = FALSE)
mtext(signif(p+(-3:3)*se,3),side=1,line=0.5,at=-3:3)
mtext(TeX("\\hat{p}="),line=0.5,side=1,at=-3.6)
axis(side=1, line=2,at=-3:3, labels = FALSE)
mtext(-3:3,side=1,line=2.5,at=-3:3)
mtext(c("z="),line=2.5,side=1,at=-3.6)
polygon(c(zs[zs<=-abs(z)], -abs(z), -3),c(ys[zs<=-abs(z)], 0, 0), col=rgb(1,0,0,0.5))
polygon(c(zs[zs>=abs(z)], 3, abs(z)),c(ys[zs>=abs(z)], 0, 0), col=rgb(1,0,0,0.5))
lines(c(-3,3),c(0,0),'l',lwd=1)
```

To determine that two-tail area, we use the z table.
$$\begin{aligned}
p\text{-value} &= P(|Z|>`r abs(z)`) \\
               &= 2\cdot P(Z<`r -abs(z)`) \\
               &= `r Pr` 
\end{aligned}$$

Compare $p$-value to $\alpha$ (which is `r alpha`).
$$p\text{-value} `r sym` \alpha $$
Make the conclusion: we `r wrd3` the null hypothesis.

`r ans`


Answerlist
--------
* Two-tail proportion test
* Hypotheses: $H_0 \text{ claims } p = `r p`$  and $H_\text{A} \text{ claims } p \ne `r p`$.
* The $p$-value is `r Pr`
* We `r wrd3` the null hypothesis.
* `r ans`
